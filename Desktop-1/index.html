	<h1>Programming Language Trends</h1>
	<h2>I am interested in exploring the popularity of programming languages and their trends over time. My question is: What are the top programming languages used by developers and how has their usage changed over the past decade?

	<h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>I found relevant data on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which is conducted annually and provides insights into the programming community. The data is publicly available and can be downloaded in CSV format.</p>
	<h2>Data Storage</h2>
	<p>I stored the data on Google Drive for easy access and sharing with the virtual audience. I also used Google Sheets to clean and analyze the data.</p>
    <h2>Presentation Materials</h2>
    <p>I used Google Sheets to create visualizations of the data, including bar charts and line graphs. I also used Tableau Public to create interactive dashboards that allow the audience to explore the data on their own.</p>
    
    <h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data, the top programming languages used by developers in 2021 are JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Python, and Java. However, the usage of these languages has changed over the past decade.
    </p>   
    <p>In 2011, the top programming languages were Java, C#, PHP, JavaScript, and C++. Over the years, the usage of Java and C++ has declined while the usage of Python and JavaScript has increased. Additionally, new languages such as TypeScript and Kotlin have emerged and gained popularity.</p> 
    <p>Overall, the Stack Overflow Developer Survey data provides valuable insights into the programming community and its trends over time. By using modern software tools such as Google Sheets and Tableau Public, we can analyze and visualize the data in a way that is informative and engaging for a virtual audience.</p>
